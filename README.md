# Stat 184-Hatfield (Fall 2022) Final Project

This repo will serve as the template file for the course project. Further, this README file will contain the project specifications (details), check points, and the list of learning outcomes being assessed. Be sure to read through all portions of the README carefully.

## Project Purpose

The purpose of this project is to provide you with an opportunity to put into practice *everything* that you have learned over the course of the semester and to push yourselves. To this end, you'll be posing your own research question(s) which you'll use to guide yourselves in exploratory data anlysis. An example report (that has a few extra features) is found in this repo.

## Project Specifications 

Use the following checklist to ensure that you have completed all of the tasks.

- [ ] Read through README
- [ ] Find 1 or 2 other individuals who you want to work with and form a team. (NOTE: unless you have specifically been given permission to do so, you may not work alone.)
- [ ] Create a repo using this repo as the template. Name your repo "FP_Name1_Name2_Name3" where Name# are the team member's names.
- [ ] Make sure that each team member has access to the repo.
- [ ] Come up with a topic and set of research questions your team will explore.
- [ ] Make a plan for your work.
- [ ] Locate appropriate data sources for your project.
  - [ ] Your main data source may __not__ be one that we used in class nor be found in any R package.
  - [ ] Supplementary data sources may come from anywhere.
- [ ] Read in your data and perform any necessary data wrangling and cleaning.
- [ ] Conduct Exploratory Data Analysis.
- [ ] Prepare a reproducible report
  - [ ] Use a RMD file; output type is your choice.
  - [ ] The report should be well organized with section headings
  - [ ] Code should be collapsed/hidden for HTML, and R Notebooks or in a Code Appendix at the end for a PDF.
  - [ ] All outputs should be accompanied by narrative text to explain what the reader should be seeing.
  - [ ] State your research questions and explain them.
  - [ ] Describe your data sources (where they come from, what was their original purpose, who/what comprise the cases in each).
  - [ ] Describe what attributes you'll focus your analysis on (mention if they are part of your data sets or if you created them out of your data sets).
  - [ ] Create multiple data visualizations that assist both the team and readers in understanding the data.
    - Data visualizations should show a variety of your skills and geometries.
    - __Optional__: If your research question/data make sense to do so, try creating a map.
  - [ ] Create at least one visual table (not a display of raw data) that assists both the team and readers in understanding the data.
  - [ ] Have narrative text explaining every data visualization and table as well as setting a framework.
  - [ ] All code should be written according to a Style Guide of your choice. List this Style Guide as a code comment in your first code chunk.
  - [ ] __Optional:__ For those who want to challenge themselves further, feel free to include a section on using other statistical methods such as hypothesis testing, regression, ANOVA, or machine learning--see Chapter 18 of the Data Computing eBook.
- [ ] Use GitHub to share changes and edits; there should be multiple commits to your repo and at least 2 by each team member. You'll need to give Neil (neilhatfield) access to your repo.
- [ ] __Optional:__ Your group may also wish to use `trackdown`
- [ ] You'll submit an output file of your choice, the RMD, and a link to your GitHub Repo.
- [ ] Update this README file to check off all elements you have completed by placing an x in side the square brackets: [x]
